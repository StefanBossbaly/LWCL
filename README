Lightweight C Library (LWCL)

--- README ---

--- ABOUT ---
A simple C library written by a bored college student. This library is
still very much in development. Eventually I will be adding more data
structures. This is a great solution for simple programs or if you
need data strutures for low power devices (for example Arduino).

--- Compiling ---
This project uses a make file to build. Each data structure has its
own test program. The name of the test program is the name of the data
structure appended with "test". For example if I wanted to build the
vector test program, the name of the build target would be 
"vectortest". And the make command to build it would be ...
make vectortest

--- Executing --
To execute the test program simply run the program from the terminal 
like so
./vectortest
