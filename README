Lightweight C Library (LWCL)

--- README ---

--- ABOUT ---
A simple C library written by a bored college student. This library is
still very much in development. Eventually I will be adding more data
structures. This is a great solution for simple programs or if you
need data strutures low power devices (for example Arduino).

--- Compiling ---
gcc linkedlist.c main.c -o c_library

--- Executing --
./c_library
